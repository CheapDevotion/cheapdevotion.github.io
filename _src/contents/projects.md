Most of my projects for [TecStar](http://www.tecstarconsulting.com) are usually under NDA, but I maintain quite a few personal projects.  
##Current Projects
**Pac Quest** - A retro top-down multiplayer battle area game for consoles and desktop. A lot of my blog posts over the next few months will probably be about this project.  

**AnimTools** - A simple animation tool built with HaxeFlixel for artist [Ryan DeGange](http://empireeden.com) to test and tweak his spritesheet animations. 

##Shelved (for now) Projects
**HitPoints App** - a mobile pedometer app with an API designed specifically for games. Walking while this app is active will benefit you in the games that implement the API.

**Gist Todo** - a node.js based commandline application for managing your Todo.txt file as a Github Gist. 

##Past Projects
**[GameBuild](https://github.com/CheapDevotion/game-build)** - A preconfigured gruntfile for building HTML5 games and webapps as desktop applications using node-webkit.  

**[Unity Steganography](https://github.com/CheapDevotion/Steganography)** - A Unity class for store data inside the pixel data of an image.
